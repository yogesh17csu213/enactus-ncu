                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Seeing Opportunity</h4>
                                    <p>Kumhar gram a potters village in uttamnagar,delhi consisting of 3000 potters families who have been struggling to match up with the pace of constantly modernising world. The demand of these beautiful pottery products made has been consistently declining, resulting in low income, poor living standards, shift in occupation. We found out that 1 in every 3 people have left pottery or are planning to leave pottery due to lack of opportunities. As a result pottery which is our traditional art is on the verge of extinction From our surveys we understood that the major problem, they face is disguised unemployement. Due to which the whole family is working but their earning is still not enough. They receive low profits because of complete reliance on middleman and contractors for orders. Gender inequality is a common picture, where women are considered well enough for odd jobs only. Despite of their talent or interest, they are not allowed to sit on wheels to make any product.</p>
                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Taking Action</h4>
                                    <p>We identified potential families where more than 3 people were employed in pottery and still their family income was less than 10,000. We identified their skills and worked with them individually to utilise their potential and increase the family income.


                                        <h5>1.Education</h5>
                                       
                                        Through extensive brainstorming sessions we understood that the way to revive pottery is to pass it to the next generation. Since, education is the most powerful weapon to change the world, we decided to educate more people about pottery. We ENACTUS NCU believe, if children were exposed to this wonderful art in their formative years it would inculcate a sense of value to revive this forgotten art and their culture. Various surveys were conducted and the result was alarming because 99 out of 100 schools havenâ€™t introduced pottery to their students The first step was to get all the potters certified.  We organised 8 workshops under the guidance of Ms RekhaBajpe, founder of Re4Clay and member of Delhi blue potters, to embellish the skills of potters to the core perfection - Second step was to improve their communicational skills to make them professional and fit for the school environment. Third, We helped them in creating their CVs and also trainedthem on how to give interviews. Fourth, Our team along with our potters designed a curriculum, to make these sessions an interactive medium to learn. Fifth, Proposals were sent to schools urging them to include pottery as a part of club activity. it not only helped our target community but also the students as pottery helps in enhancing sensory development and motor skills. Interested schools were approached and our potters accompanied us in all these meetings, to understand the process well so that in future they themselves become capable of interacting with schools and thus under taking business initiatives to make them independent and self-reliant.
                                        
                                        
                                        <h5>2.Business Development</h5>
                                        At first, We selected one member of the family for marketing and finance. This person was trained by Enactus NCU in procuring orders, effective communication, understanding market needs and Book Keeping. Second, Our innovation was merged with the creativity of the potters which resulted in the introduction of new productâ€™s along with the existing ones Third, An analysis was done to tap the potential market. We connected them with various business chains so that the concept of middle-men gets eradicated and their business also expands. Fourth, the need of the hour was to provide a platform for this art to reach beyond the narrow lanes of Uttam Nagar and mark its presence in a wider market.  And to do this we created a market through our website, where these products could reach to a larger part of the society. This platform of e-commerce not only helped buyers to directly reach to our potters but at the same time, provide the exact same products at a cheaper rate than any other e commerce website.<br>
                                        
                                        
                                        <h5>3.Production and Packaging</h5>
                                        As we were working on this project, we found out that production and packaging was also a major problem, specially for the buyers. To make the process of packaging and production more efficient we connected the potters to the nearest kabadiwallas to source cheap and accessible cardboard boxes. Simultaneously, we found out that the dry grass which was eariler used in packaging was a source of problem for the buyers and thus we suggested the potters to replace it with the waste material of paper bowls and paper plates. This strategy not only helped us in tackling the issue of hygiene but also was more economical. 4. Logistic Earlier, customers getting products from kumhaar gram had to work out on the logistics themselves. For the oneâ€™s who were unfamiliar to the process, the options available in the colony would charge hefty amounts. To make it convenient for our customers we partnered our potters with 2 more people Jackie bhaiya and X bhaiya , who now strengthen our project at the logistic end. This not only allowed our customers to get their products on the minimum rates but also helped our potters to control the end price.</p>
                                        <h4 class="text-uppercase">Enabling process</h4>
                                   <p>Project kumhaar provided employment to 14 people in all. Education Under this 4 potters were trained to give workshops. They are employed by 4 schools as pottery teachers to conduct a workshop per week therefore increasing their permanent income by Rs. 4000 per month. Operating on a private basis they have conducted 30 private workshops at various platforms touching the lives of about 1980 students in total. Through Business development 8 people were employed under this initiative. We partnered with 9 new organisations including offices, canteens, cafes, restaurants etc.Which led to an increase of orders of about 8000 products per month.And increasing the income by Rs. 2400 per month for each family. Logistics Logistics gave an employment to 2 people thereby Yielding an income of Rs.700 per order And after the expenses the earning was Rs.300 per order i.e. a total extra earning of Rs. 2700 per month per person. In the last 1 year project kumhar has given employment to 14 people, thereby increasing a familyâ€™s income by closely 7000( 6866) per month. Out of which 5 women were empowered by unleashing their potential, shattering a taboo and recognizing them as potential workforce, and as a consequence their income increased, level of discrimination decreased, this gave a boost to their confidence. In our operation, we produced 48000 pieces of clay products, thereby preventing usage of 384kg plastic. we reduced the energy requirement for production from 550 kj to 147 kj per cup and henceforth minimizing emission of 23.5 kg greenhouse gas.

                                    Through project kumhaar, our objective was twofold, firstly it was to revive the dying art of pottery and secondly to find an eco-friendly alternative for plastic.A plastic cup requires approximately 90 years to decompose whereas clay is biodegradable and sustainable. Energy requirement for production of a plastic cup amounts to 550kj/cup whereas a clay cup requires only 147kj/cup. Also  1 tonne of plastic produces 61kg of greenhouse gas. In our operation, we produced 48000 pieces of clay products, thereby preventing usage of 384kg plastic and henceforth reduced 23.5 kg of greenhouse gas emission.</p>

                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Seeing Opportunity</h4><p>Imagine waking up to the smell of rafflesia and opening your eyes to picture a huge heap of garbage awaiting clingy flies and several species of insects buzzing around your window. When garbage clogs the existence of a society and its neighbouring environment, we know we are in for unhygienic living. Garbage heaps left in the open to rot in the areas of Delhi NCR called out for responsibility and this is where our team stepped in to initiate measures for proper waste management. Environmental factors like foul smell, hazardous gases released when garbage heaps are burnt and escaping of non biodegradable waste into the nearby drains, causing clogging; demanded urgent action. Social factors such as shortage of living space, exploitation of the right to a healthy lifestyle and inequalities that persist in the society, gave us more reason to quicken our measures of doing away with unhealthy living. Economic factors like lack of resources and education still compel a major fraction of people, to dwell in the lap of an ailing mother. All these points were enough to fuel us to drive away this garbage monster out of sight. Project Ehsaas was our biggest remedy to cure this illness and to provide people with a green environment to live in. This also ensured that households now had to look for better ways to dispose off garbage, for the heaps that were a common place for throwing waste now ceased to exist. Our project gave people a new vision to follow proper garbage disposal and to understand the matter concerning the health of the environment as well as that of the society.</p>
                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Taking Action</h4><p>The most appropriate way to solve this issue was source segregation. Our collaboration with the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon was a stepping stone which further led us to associate with Gurgaon First for the launch of a waste management handbook by Rao Inderjeet Singh Ji, Member of Parliament. MCG collaborated us with SAAHAS NGO, which is constantly working for the past 15 years to initiate efficient waste management policies. SAAHAS NGO, MCG and ENACTUS NCU was therefore a perfect match. Eventually several RWAs were approached in over 2000 houses of Sector 45,56,Nirvana Fresco and many more where waste collectors were trained regarding proper segregation techniques considering which garbage carts were partitioned into two halves for wet and dry waste. Next step was to create awareness among the masses for which door to door campaigns were conducted. People were sensitized by means of presentations,videos, small events were organized and multilingual posters were put up on social platforms. We held workshops to train the maids and the sweepers working in the societies regarding waste segregation at source level. We realized that the need of the hour is not just maximizing the profits for the waste collectors but also to improve their working conditions by making it highly organized and improving hygienic conditions. Basic practices of using gloves, masks, soap, keeping the surrounding clean etc. were inculcated in the training module. Finally the compost plant setup in the community centre near sector 45 was inaugurated by the commissioner of MCG which became our source of manure, free from any sort of chemical effluents since it was derived from biodegradable waste. Later, the manure was supplied to gardeners who played the role of a beneficiary by planting herbs and other plants in households and societies that were keen to initiate kitchen gardens or portable plants at their place.Customer specific orders were given to gardeners, depending upon the choice of plants and the type of containers the people wanted it to be planted in, such as earthen pots or reused plastic bottles, which, in turn, were being reused in the process, while they are normally considered as waste once used. As a part of the services offered to our customers the gardeners paid regular visits to keep a check on the maintenance of plants</p>
                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Enabling process</h4><p>Project Ehsaas has made a major impact and has brought about some real change. During the course of this project, 19 beneficiaries were given employment. These people were given the opportunity to take better control of their lives with the help of a stable source of income. As a part of Project Ehsaas, over 200 tonnes of waste was diverted from the Bhandwari village. We were able to create an impact when it came to effective waste management. Consequently, the yearly revenue collected was over rupees 3.8L. From the amount of waste being generated, over 130 tonnes of waste was recycled or reused. With 13 gardeners employed, their monthly income increased by rupees 5700 which made a huge difference to our project. Thus, not only is Project Ehsaas helping in giving employment to waste collectors and gardeners but also it has a strong positive impact towards the environment. One of the main aims of Project Ehsaas was to reduce the amount of carbon and plastic being generated.It is with great pride that we say that our efforts showed positive results. Project Ehsaas is an eco-friendly, sustainable and scalable approach to sensitize people about the benefits of organic farming, while helping weaker sections of society get that extra financial support they require. It is scalable in the sense that further collaborations with MCG will help advance wide reach of Ehsaas. Waste management is a widespread issue, particularly so in urban areas. Thus, Ehsaas will continue to be impactful for a long period of time. After bringing back order to chaos by redefining standards for sanitation and cleanliness, our focus shifted to the other faces of natureâ€™s turmoil.</p>

You are sitting comfortably in your car, at a traffic light junction, you see a little child begging you to let him clean your windshield so he could earn a few coins to make it through the day. Then you see a disabled woman, the childâ€™s mother. And suddenly you realise, what a pitiful life such people lead, where children are forced to earn for survival just because their disabled parents are unemployed. Two different scenarios- one project. With this ladies and gentlemen, we unfurl in front of you our next project- project inaayat. Our idea is to manufacture pencils out of waste newspapers. But this is not it, the manufacturing of these pencils has given employment to the community of the disabled. This employment opportunity has changed the way these people look at life. From years of worthlessness to realising their latent potentials, the disabled people have finally come to view themselves shoulder to shoulder with the others. Not only has their self esteem enhanced, but the happiness you see on their faces? It will melt anyoneâ€™s heart anyday. The degrading environmental conditions such as deforestation and hazardous air index in Delhi also called for an eco-friendly approach towards the project. Eliminating the use of wood to make pencils, the newspapers left to rot have instead been recycled to build an eco friendly product. This comes with an added advantage of genuine prices, as opposed to the high costs of wooden pencils. All this, without compromising the quality of the pencils? The level of satisfaction that this project has given us is unparalleled. We have seen it all, from a mere idea to a self sustained society of workers, this project makes all our efforts and funding campaigns worth their while. One disability equals the birth of a newer, much keener sense. All one has to do is to *realise* and *believe.*

                                        <h4 class="text-uppercase">Taking Action</h4><p>To be able to empathize and understand the circumstances the disabled go through everyday our team collaborated with the â€˜Family of Disabledâ€™, an NGO which has been engaged in the service of people with disability for the past 25 years. The task at hand now was to procure the essential elements and equipment to set up a machine that produced newspaper pencils of good quality. After conducting an intensive research, a virtual design was made for the same keeping in mind the estimated cost of the machine to be around Rs 8,00,000. The team then started looking for a contractor who could make the machine as per our specifications and we successfully found one in Gujarat. In a span of 3 days, our team of 48 members were able to raise an amount of rupees 4,00,000 through crowd funding and the rest amount was raised by FOD. Keeping in mind the very basic raw material required for making the pencils, i.e. newspapers, our team created a channel of collecting newspapers on a monthly basis. This was done by approaching our neighbours, family friends and people associated with FOD. This resulted in more than 800 households coming together for a noble cause. Further, FOD provided us with working space at their Najafgarh centre. In order to identify our beneficiaries, we took support from FOD to get the data of disabled people in the nearby areas. The next hurdle was to reach out to these people and we took the initiative of conducting door to door survey campaigns for two weeks. With the hope of putting the disabled people at ease we tried to build a healthy rapport with them and FOD helped us make communication a lot easier. Additionally, a technician from Gujarat was called to not only configure the machine but also to enhance the technical skills of the disabled people so that they could operate the machine independently. Thus, they felt emboldened and motivated with a sense of purpose which was earlier missing. Being employed helped them achieve a certain level of financial independence and induced a strong and positive response on their self-confidence. Having created an eco-friendly and biodegradable product, we were also able to combat the environmental factors. With the goal of maximizing our reach for the project, we approached schools, colleges, hotels, MNCs and PSUs for the sale of these pencils on a contract basis. We promoted the product at various platforms like Raahgiri, set up stalls at events, and conducted awareness campaigns in schools particularly during PTMs to spread knowledge to the parents as well. Also, certain individuals were identified during this process whose communication and marketing skills were honed so as to enhance them for future benefits. And to do that, we made sure to take at least one disabled person with us in each of our meetings and campaigns.</p>
                                        <h4 class="text-uppercase">Enabling process</h4><p>Through project Inaayat, we have employed 12 disabled people that are earning 8 - 10 thousand per month. These people are now capable of supporting themselves and their families to some extent. Additionally, Inaayat has directly impacted around more than 16 thousand people that are using the newspaper pencils we make and our taking a step towards saving the environment and promoting our pencils. These pencils are not only eco-friendly and chemical-free but are also as sturdy as a regular wooden pencil. The sole aim of Project Inaayat actively promotes the use of eco-friendly newspaper pencils. Inaayat has had numerous positive impacts, that too on a large scale. It promotes recycling of waste newspaper which in turn promotes effective waste management. This is of special importance given the gigantic amount of waste that is generated in India. Another impact is that it focuses on sustainability and thereby saving our environment. Thus, Inaayat has resulted in the reduction of more than 6 tonnes of carbon emissions. Project Inaayat is a highly sustainable and scalable venture which has also been able to successfully promote the 'Make in India' campaign. For the sustainability of the project, the principal raw material required - newspaper - is rarely going to cease production. This ensures reliability of the project on the chosen raw material. In the future, we intend to decentralize the project in order to increase the reach of the project and thus lending employment opportunities to as many people as possible. Another aspect of Inaayat is the fact that it is scalable. In order to increase the sustainability and Scalability of the project several distributors were contacted.</p>
